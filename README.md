# Improving-Performance-and-Security-of-Data-Transmission-Using-Enhanced-Symmetric-Encryption

Overview

This project presents a novel symmetric encryption model implemented in Java, which integrates data compression and Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) techniques to optimize both performance and security in data transmission.
By compressing data before encryption and employing FHSS, the solution delivers significant throughput gains while reducing CPU utilization, making it ideal for secure, high-performance communication scenarios.

Key Features

Enhanced Symmetric Encryption: Utilizes a robust symmetric cipher augmented with data compression and FHSS for added security layers.

Data Compression: Reduces payload size before encryption, decreasing transmission time and bandwidth usage.

Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS): Adds resilience against eavesdropping and jamming by rapidly switching transmission frequencies.

Java Implementation: Fully implemented in Java for cross-platform compatibility and easy integration.

Performance Optimizations: Demonstrates a 2Ã— throughput improvement and a 30% reduction in CPU usage on large data transfers compared to standard symmetric encryption implementations.
